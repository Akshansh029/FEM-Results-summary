## My process
I started my process by dividing the layout into divs and started coding by writing HTML code and after completing HTML, I started with CSS from top to bottom flow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I still need to learn more about CSS grid layout and responsiveness using media queries.
